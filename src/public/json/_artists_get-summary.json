So it was a surprise when the band announced 2007’s <i>Long Road Out of Eden</i>, a sprawling 20-track double album of new material. Back in the 1970s, Don Henley and Glenn Frey wrote their biggest songs at each other’s Hollywood homes after nights out on the town. This time, things were different: Frey worked out of his West LA studio, while Henley worked in Malibu, with the two emailing their contributions to one another—a setup that allowed them to avoid the inevitable in-person friction.\n\nTheir longtime producer, Bill Szymczyk, returned to serve as \"a mediator, a consigliere, a ringmaster,\" while Henley and Frey wrote about more serious topics, like the death of the American dream. Just listen to the title track, a menacing, 10-minute Henley epic about greedy oil men. Then there’s “Business as Usual,” in which Henley—an outspoken environmentalist—sings about how “nature’s buried in the rubble.” Frey’s “I Dreamed There Was No War,” meanwhile, is a spare, meditative electric guitar instrumental that proves the Eagles don’t even have to sing to record a classic.\n\nThey do sing spectacularly, though: Henley’s “Waiting in the Weeds” is a dark, end-of-summer ballad wrapped in Beach Boys-style harmonies. And J.D. Souther, who co-wrote Eagles hits like “Heartache Tonight,” contributes “How Long,” a throwback windows-down anthem sung by Henley and Frey. What’s most notable about <i>Long Road Out of Eden</i>, though, is the way it lets the band embrace their age—and allows them to acknowledge how much they’ve grown since their early days. On “Busy Being Fabulous,” Henley delivers a swaggering soul ballad about a lover who’s traded her loyalty for late nights and bright lights. And Joe Walsh’s “Last Good Time in Town” is a delightful update on his party classic “Life’s Been Good”—except now, Walsh has new ways of getting thrills: “Lately I’ve been stayin’ at home/Workin’ the crosswords/Turn off the phone.”"},"isComplete":true},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1714527159282}}},"635791801":{"id":"635791801","type":"albums","attributes":{"copyright":"℗ 1972 Asylum Records.

Most mornings, Frey heard Browne as he played the piano, working on such future hits like “Doctor, My Eyes.” “I’m going, ‘So <i>that’s</i> how you do it,’” Frey later recalled in <i>History of the Eagles</i>. “‘Elbow grease. Time. Thought. Persistence.’”\n\nThe Eagles formed at LA’s Troubadour, where drummer Don Henley and guitarist Glenn Frey met at the bar, bonding over their love of cars and music. After playing some shows together as backup for Linda Ronstadt, they hatched a plan to start their own group, featuring the best players in LA’s country-rock scene. Ronstadt connected them with Bernie Leadon, a veteran of the Flying Burrito Brothers; they also recruited bassist Randy Meisner, who played in Poco and Ricky Nelson’s band.\n\nThough Henley and Frey weren’t seasoned songwriters yet, the Eagles’ self-titled 1972 debut album proved they knew how to pick material. The group covered Jack Tempchin’s breezy classic “Peaceful Easy Feeling,” adding gorgeous three-part harmonies. Meanwhile, Frey recruited his neighbor Browne, asking if he could finish the work-in-progress song “Take It Easy,” an anthem about cars, girls, and redemption. And Henley scored his first writing triumph when he heard Leadon playing a guitar riff, and went home and wrote the lyrics to “Witchy Woman.”\n\nProduced by Glyn Johns, <i>Eagles</i> was a huge surprise success. “Take It Easy,” “Peaceful Easy Feeling,” and “Witchy Woman” all made the Top 40. Leadon, reflecting decades later, believed it was because the band offered hope after the dark 1960s: “I really think that part of the reason that the Eagles succeeded the way they did was because the country and people and young people needed to feel like things were OK.”"},"isComplete":true},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1716550956441}}},"1293903288":{"id":"1293903288","type":"albums","attributes":{"copyright":"℗ 2017, 1976 Elektra/Asylum Records.

Souther. At their favorite restaurant next to the Los Angeles club the Troubadour, Frey noticed an attractive blonde woman out to dinner with a much older man. “Look at those lyin’ eyes,” Frey said, before immediately picking up a pen. The moment was, of course, the genesis of the Eagles’ “Lyin’ Eyes,” which Bob Buziak, the former president of RCA Records, called “among the best LA rock ’n’ roll songs ever written.”\n \nReleased in 1975, <i>One of These Nights</i> was the Eagles most “painless” album, according to Frey, whose songwriting partnership with Don Henley was hitting new peaks. Sharing a Beverly Hills home together, the two wrote classic after classic: The sleazy dance-floor stomper “One of These Nights,” and “Take It to the Limit,” an anthem about the downsides of life on the road, co-written with Randy Meisner. While chronicling fame’s dark side can be a tired trope, Henley and Frey proved they were keen observers of life in the fast lane. “The only two people in this group who tend to think alike are Glenn and me,” said Henley, “and we’ve always wanted every song to be the best that it could be.”\n\nWorking with their producer Bill Szymczyk, the band took new risks. They layered complex guitar riffs on “Too Many Hands,” and built Bernie Leadon’s banjo instrumental “Journey of the Sorcerer” into a folk-prog epic. Inspired by Al Green, Henley belted the title track with a soulful falsetto over a four-on-the-floor dance groove.\n \nNot everyone was happy with the sessions. Leadon resented Henley and Frey listening to demos and making changes without the rest of the band, and at one point disappeared from sessions for three days. He left the group in 1975.  \n<i>One of These Nights</i> became the band’s first album to top the Billboard charts, producing a trio of hit singles: “One of These Nights,” “Lyin’ Eyes,” and “Take It to the Limit.” It also propelled the group to stadium-headliner status. “Although there were still disparities within the band in terms of songwriting, direction, [and more],” Henley said later, “Glenn and I now wanted to take advantage of the momentum we had going. We wanted to write more songs that would be played on the radio.” Mission accomplished."},"isComplete":true},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1716473691534}}},"193434857":{"id":"193434857","type":"albums","attributes":{"copyright":"℗ 1980 Elektra/Asylum Records for the United States and WEA International for the world outside of the US","genreNames":["Rock","Music","Pop","Pop/Rock","Arena Rock","Southern Rock","Soft Rock"],"releaseDate":"1980-11-07","isMasteredForItunes":false,"upc":"075596059169","artwork":{"width":2400,"url":"https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Features114/v4/e4/6c/3d/e46c3d30-9a32-b984-ee6f-ea473723a651/contsched.tidyyafg.jpg/{w}x{h}bb.jpg","height":2400,"textColor3":"dfa584","textColor2":"e5b486","textColor4":"d39471","textColor1":"f3c99e","bgColor":"8e141e","hasP3":false},"playParams":{"id":"193434857","kind":"album"},"url":"https://music.apple.com/us/album/eagles-live/193434857","recordLabel":"Elektra Records","isCompilation":false,"trackCount":15,"isPrerelease":false,"audioTraits":["lossless","lossy-stereo"],"isSingle":false,"name":"Eagles Live","artistName":"Eagles","editorialNotes":{"short":"Taking it to the limit one more time.","standard":"Released only months after the group announced their breakup, <i>Eagles Live</i> feels like a final encore.

Early sessions for the band’s third album were a “disaster area,” said their producer Glyn Johns, who’d been hesitant to work with the Eagles from the start. By the time <i>On the Border</i> got underway, Johns’ relationship with the group had soured: He didn’t think the band members should abandon their country-folk roots, Frey resented Johns’ no-substance policy in the studio, and Don Henley was unhappy with the way Johns had recorded his drums.\n\nAfter six unproductive weeks, the band members packed their bags and headed back to LA, where they found a new producer: Bill Szymczyk, who’d worked with the James Gang and produced Joe Walsh’s solo albums. Szymczyk would help turn the Eagles into the biggest band in the world, encouraging them to get louder and funkier.\n\nThe result was 1974’s <i>On the Border</i>, the Eagles’ sound-shifting third album. The band members are clearly having a blast on such tracks as “James Dean”—a rowdy tribute to the tragic movie star, co-written with Jackson Browne—and “Midnight Flyer,” a banjo-laden stomper sung by Randy Meisner. Bernie Leadon, meanwhile, contributed “My Man,” a tribute to Gram Parsons, whom Leadon had played with in The Flying Burrito Brothers.\n \nStill, if the Eagles wanted to become a <i>real</i> rock band, Szymczyk thought, they needed another guitarist. He recommended Don Felder, who’d toured with David Crosby and Graham Nash. The band invited Felder to play slide guitar on “Good Day in Hell”—with memorable results. “With every take, he just blew us all away,” Frey said. “If he isn’t Duane Allman reincarnate, I don’t know who the fuck is.”\n \n<i>On the Border</i> ends with “The Best of My Love,” an acoustic ballad inspired by Henley’s breakup with girlfriend Suzannah Martin. It became the band’s first chart-topping song in the United States—but there was one hiccup. According to the book <i>To the Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles</i>, the label had edited the single down to under four minutes, without telling the band. Henley was furious, and attempted to have the single pulled from record stores. When the song sold a million copies, Eagles manager Irving Azoff sent the band a gold record with a piece of the record chopped out."},"isComplete":true},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1716924405783}}},"635815754":{"id":"635815754","type":"albums","attributes":{"copyright":"℗ 1978 Elektra Records.

Sitting at the piano overlooking the city, Henley played “Desperado,” a ballad inspired by Ray Charles’ <i>Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music</i>. Frey told Henley he needed to finish it. “He said, ‘This is really good, man,’” Henley later remembered.\n\nThe band desperately needed inspiration after the surprise success of their 1972 debut album. “Don Henley and I sort of looked at each other and said, ‘We better start writing some good songs, or we’re not going to be around here for very long,’” said Frey. They found inspiration in a coffee-table book belonging to Jackson Browne, one that covered the history of the gunfighters of the Old West. Reading about the Dalton gang, a family of officers turned train robbers, Frey and collaborator J.D. Souther wrote “Doolin-Dalton,” a meditative ballad about an outlaw stuck in a cycle of violence, gambling, and women. The song became a recurring motif on <i>Desperado</i>, the Eagles’ 1973 sophomore album. “The basic premise was that, like the outlaws, rock ’n’ roll bands lived outside the ‘laws of normality,’” said Henley. “We all went from town to town, collecting money and women—the critical difference being that we didn't rob or kill anybody for what we got. We <i>worked</i> for it.”\n\nAfter Henley and Frey wrote “Desperado,” Frey brought another classic to the table: “Tequila Sunrise.” Frey initially thought it was cliché to write a song about the popular tequila and orange juice drink, but Henley convinced him it could be more than that, resulting in a song about the sad cycle of relationships on the road. “I don't think there's a single chord out of place,” said Frey later. The band also included “Out of Control,” a rowdy party anthem with a fiery slide solo by Frey, and Bernie Leadon’s “Twenty-One,” which he wrote about Emmett Dalton, the young outlaw who survived 23 gunshot wounds when his gang raided the two banks in Coffeyville, Kansas, in 1892.\n\nHenley recorded “Desperado” live in London’s Island studios, backed by musicians from the London Philharmonic. “I was scared shitless,” says Henley, who complained years later he could have sang the track a lot better. While <i>Desperado</i> wasn’t a hit, the album proved Henley and Frey could write strong material together. “We were commenting on the ephemeral nature of success in the music business—and the outlaw business,” Henley said later. “We were attempting to presage our own demise. Problem is, we—or at least our body of work—lasted much, much longer than we would ever have suspected.”"},"isComplete":true},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1716551474578}}},"635774271":{"id":"635774271","type":"albums","attributes":{"copyright":"℗ 1979 Asylum Records.

Bassist Randy Meisner, meanwhile, had left the band in 1977, after getting into fistfight with Frey (he was replaced by Poco’s Timothy B. Schmit). Things finally took a positive turn when Frey stepped up to the mic and sang “Heartache Tonight,” a track he and Henley had written with J.D. Souther and Bob Seger. “Glenn went and sung his ass off on that track,” said guitarist Joe Walsh. “We knew then we were off the hook a little. We had a single.”\n\n<i>The Long Run</i> took three years to complete (some close to the band joked it should have been called “The Long One”). “That’s when Glenn and I started to come apart,” Henley said later in Marc Eliot’s book <i>To the Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles</i>. “We got into arguments about creativity, lyrics, and some angry words were exchanged.” Unable to write much together, the duo asked their bandmates for help. Schmit co-wrote and sang the moody classic “I Can’t Tell You Why,” which became a hit, and Joe Walsh delivered “In the City,” a heavy stomper about his humble beginnings, featuring his fiery lead guitar.\n\n<i>The Long Run</i> closes with “The Sad Cafe,” an elegy for Troubadour, the legendary LA club where, years earlier, Henley and Frey had first met. By 1979, the club was in danger of shutting down—as was Henley and Frey’s partnership. “That song is about the demise of the club, the passing of the glory years,” Henley later said. “We wrote the song as an acknowledgement that those glory days were definitely over.”"},"isComplete":true},"meta":{"contentVersion":{"RTCI":0,"MZ_INDEXER":1716928985852}}},"1440199153":{"id":"1440199153","type":"albums","attributes":{"copyright":"℗ 2018 Warner Music Group.
